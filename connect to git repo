To upload existing project in git , follow these steps:

First initialize git for your project 
""git init""

add .gitignore in your project and add files which should not be uploaded to git .
For eg : .env node_modules logs etc.

Now connect your project to your remote repo before adding / commit / pushing.
"" git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo-name.git ""

Check the above step using:
"" git remote -v ""

Use "" git branch -M master "" if you need to rename your current branch to master for consistency, compatibility, or to match the expectations of your remote repository.  

Now you just need to add your local files and commit and at last push them .

"" git add . ""
"" git commit -m "initial commit" ""

Last step push :

"" git push -u origin master ""
